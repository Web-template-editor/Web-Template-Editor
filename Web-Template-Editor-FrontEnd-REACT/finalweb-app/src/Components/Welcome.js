It is provided by various suppliers to help make Web design a lot easier for designers.A website template is also known as a Web page template or page template.<br/>

<p>React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

Component-Based
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
Learn Once, Write Anywhere
We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

<p>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

If you’re looking for information about a specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier release, check out the project release notes section on our wiki.

Features
Create stand-alone Spring applications

Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)

Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration

Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible

Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration

Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

<p>Deployment in software and web development means pushing changes or updates from one deployment environment to another. When setting up a website you will always have your live website, which is called the live environment or production environment.

If you want the ability to make changes without these affecting your live website, then you can add additional environments. These environments are called development environments or deployment environments. The additional development environments will typically be a local environment, a development environment, and a staging environment (also known as a staging site). How many environments you need is up to you and depends on the complexity of the project you are working on.

While deployment models can vary, the most common is the classic “left to right” deployment model when working with multiple deployment environments. In this model, changes are made in local, development, or staging environments (depending on the setup) and pushed from left to right through the different environments ending up in the live environment. Once this deployment process has been completed the new changes will be visible in the live environment.
